# MiniPaint


This app uses a custom view to implement drawing on a canvas in response to touch events. All drawing happens on the UI thread by overriding the custom view's onDraw() method. You can use this technique when drawing always takes less time than a screen refresh cycle on all target devices.

*This app is part of Advanced Android Kotlin Development Nanodegree Program on Udacity*
